# Minetest-bamboo

> A bamboo plant mod for Minetest

This mod adds a simple fast-growing bamboo plant to Minetest.

 - It grows up to ~24 blocks tall, or as low as 4 blocks tall
 - Every 45 seconds it has a 1 in 4 chance of of growing
 - It requires an air node above it in order to grow
 - Breaking a lower node in the plant causes all the upper ones to break too
 - It can be used as a fuel source, but it's pretty terrible :P
